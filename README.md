**CASE Statement in SQL: A README Guide**
The CASE statement in SQL is used to return specific values based on conditions. 
It works like an IF-ELSE or SWITCH statement in other programming languages, allowing you to implement conditional logic directly in your SQL queries.
**1. Purpose**
The CASE statement is used to perform conditional logic in SQL queries.
It allows you to evaluate conditions and return a value based on those conditions.
Itâ€™s commonly used for creating conditional columns in SELECT statements or in WHERE clauses.
**2. Syntax**
There are two types of CASE statements:
Simple CASE Expression
The simple CASE expression compares one expression to multiple possible values.
SELECT column_name,
       CASE column_name
           WHEN value1 THEN 'Result1'
           WHEN value2 THEN 'Result2'
           ELSE 'Default Result'
       END AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

Searched CASE Expression
The searched CASE expression allows you to use complex conditions (e.g., comparison operators) instead of directly comparing values.
SELECT column_name,
       CASE 
           WHEN condition1 THEN 'Result1'
           WHEN condition2 THEN 'Result2'
           ELSE 'Default Result'
       END AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

**3. Key Points**
CASE is used for conditional logic: You can use CASE to return different results based on different conditions in a SQL query.
CASE works in SELECT, UPDATE, WHERE, and ORDER BY clauses: This makes it a versatile tool.
ELSE is optional: If no conditions match and you don't have an ELSE clause, the result will be NULL by default.
Multiple conditions: You can use multiple conditions, but they are evaluated in order. The first condition that evaluates to true will be used.
